Hi there,

We’re excited to announce that our spreadsheet curriculum is expanding, including new courses, practice exercises, and projects. Because let’s face it: Spreadsheets are essential—and simply unavoidable—when you’re working with data. In fact, tens of millions of people around the world use spreadsheets.

Jenny Bryan, a software engineer at RStudio, puts it this way: “Spreadsheets are kind of like the English of the data world...you’re going to have to be able to cope with data that comes in that format.”

DataCamp’s spreadsheet courses will expand your spreadsheets vocabulary and techniques, and teach you the skills you need to incorporate spreadsheets into data science and analytics workflows.

Dear Aaditya,

“I'm not crying because I'm on my period. I’m crying because I can't believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar.”


These words of the award-winning filmmaker “Period. End of Sentence” are a reminder that menstruation needs to be a part of public discussion.
https://click.mail.change.org/?qs=b8fcd4487e496c9e540ceb9347e275755f6787ab78382e2ff0e325bba863429ac6ae0826df36dff75ac1e6d1dae78eebf0e105ac630f78b5028621584f5cbacf 
Sign my petition. 


Because of this film people, who would usually shy away from talking about periods are today tweeting about it!


Aaditya, all this momentum will go waste if we don’t take the next step. I need your support. 
https://click.mail.change.org/?qs=b8fcd4487e496c9e540ceb9347e275755f6787ab78382e2ff0e325bba863429ac6ae0826df36dff75ac1e6d1dae78eebf0e105ac630f78b5028621584f5cbacf

I cannot forget what a tribal girl told me during one of my workshops on periods in Jharkhand. She thought that a leech has gone inside her vagina when she had her first periods. I was shocked! Nobody had told her about periods.

I am trying my best to empower girls like her through awareness programmes. But as an individual I can reach only a mere hundred girls.


Aaditya, if the Jharkhand government takes up this issue, we can reach every girl in every remote village.

https://click.mail.change.org/?qs=b8fcd4487e496c9e540ceb9347e275755f6787ab78382e2ff0e325bba863429ac6ae0826df36dff75ac1e6d1dae78eebf0e105ac630f78b5028621584f5cbacf 
Support my campaign  asking the Jharkhand government to ensure mandatory menstrual hygiene services in all Anganwadis.

Aaditya, it is up to us to ensure that a period is the end of sentence, and not a girl’s education and dreams.


Thank you,
