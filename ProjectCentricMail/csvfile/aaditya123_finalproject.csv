-----------------------------------------------------

hi there,

we’re excited to announce that our spreadsheet curriculum is expanding, including new courses, practice exercises, and projects. because let’s face it: spreadsheets are essential—and simply unavoidable—when you’re working with data. in fact, tens of millions of people around the world use spreadsheets.

jenny bryan, a software engineer at rstudio, puts it this way: “spreadsheets are kind of like the english of the data world...you’re going to have to be able to cope with data that comes in that format.”

datacamp’s spreadsheet courses will expand your spreadsheets vocabulary and techniques, and teach you the skills you need to incorporate spreadsheets into data science and analytics workflows.

hi there,

we’re excited to announce that our spreadsheet curriculum is expanding, including new courses, practice exercises, and projects. because let’s face it: spreadsheets are essential—and simply unavoidable—when you’re working with data. in fact, tens of millions of people around the world use spreadsheets.

jenny bryan, a software engineer at rstudio, puts it this way: “spreadsheets are kind of like the english of the data world...you’re going to have to be able to cope with data that comes in that format.”

datacamp’s spreadsheet courses will expand your spreadsheets vocabulary and techniques, and teach you the skills you need to incorporate spreadsheets into data science and analytics workflows.
