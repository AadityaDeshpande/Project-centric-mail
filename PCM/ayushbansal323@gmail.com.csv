If you're a fan of Tony Robbins, there's a saying you would have heard
him say a lot...

_""Success leaves clues""_

Tony then goes on to explain that if you want the shortcut to success,
study people that have already got the results that you're hoping to
get.

But here's the part that most people miss...

Let's say the results you're trying to emulate are business results...

Don't JUST copy what they do in business!

See, what makes a person successful at what they do is not just the
obvious stuff they do... it's the whole package!

With that in mind, I made you this quick video that runs you through
MY morning ritual. Here's everything I do when I wake up in the
morning.

We celebrate bold entrepreneurs whose ingenuity led them to success, but what happens to those who fail? Far too often, they bury their stories out of shame or humiliation -- and miss out on a valuable opportunity for growth, says author and entrepreneur Leticia Gasca. In this thoughtful talk, Gasca calls for business owners to open up about their failures and makes the case for replacing the idea of ""failing fast"" with a new mantra: fail mindfully.

Imagine a workplace where people of all colors and races are able to climb every rung of the corporate ladder -- and where the lessons we learn about diversity at work actually transform the things we do, think and say outside the office. How do we get there? In this candid talk, inclusion advocate Janet Stovall shares a three-part action plan for creating workplaces where people feel safe and expected to be their unassimilated, authentic selves.

In a series of mind-bending demos, inventor Mary Lou Jepsen shows how we can use red light to see and potentially stimulate what's inside our bodies and brains. Taking us to the edge of optical physics, Jepsen unveils new technologies that utilize light and sound to track tumors, measure neural activity and could possibly replace the MRI machine with a cheaper, more efficient and wearable system.

What do communities on the social, economic and environmental margins have in common? For one thing, they tend to be on the east sides of cities. In this short talk about a surprising insight, anthropologist and venture capitalist Stephen DeBerry explains how both environmental and man-made factors have led to disparity by design in cities from East Palo Alto, California to East Jerusalem and beyond -- and suggests some elegant solutions to fix it.

When bankers refused to serve her neighbors in rural India, Chetna Gala Sinha did the next best thing: she opened a bank of her own, the first ever for and by women in the country. In this inspiring talk, she shares stories of the women who encouraged her and continue to push her to come up with solutions for those denied traditional financial backing.

In this eye-opening talk about the impact of race and neighborhood on foster-care decisions, social worker Jessica Pryce shares a promising solution to help child welfare agencies make bias-free assessments about when to remove children from their families. ""Let's work together to build a system that wants to make families stronger instead of pulling them apart,"" Pryce says.

In a series of mind-bending demos, inventor Mary Lou Jepsen shows how we can use red light to see and potentially stimulate what's inside our bodies and brains. Taking us to the edge of optical physics, Jepsen unveils new technologies that utilize light and sound to track tumors, measure neural activity and could possibly replace the MRI machine with a cheaper, more efficient and wearable system.

My team and myself have spent months and months putting together a
tool that I really believe will make a huge difference on your
entrepreneurial journey.

It's essentially a quiz, but I hate calling it that, because when I
think quiz, I think about those things you see on Facebook that tell
you _which Game of Thrones charactor you are._

No, this is SSSOO much more than that!

Take the quiz now [https://track.slsv2.com/track/click/TPZYhXjC4Q/ee15bd34b32466efc57b63586fd1a8ef/6812077f681ce72345cb52cdee72242d/inbox16

This is 75 questions designed to pin point exactly what your strengths
are, and what you need to work on in relation to your journey to
successful entrepreneurship.

The end result isn't just a token paragraph, you'll get a complete
breakdown of 25 different characteristics, a score from 0-100 for each
of them, and direction as to how you can improve your score _(yep,
it's not set in stone!)_

I really don't feel like I can possibly do this justice by trying to
describe it. All I can say is...

Just do it - You'll see!

Take the eSCORE Assessment Now

We celebrate bold entrepreneurs whose ingenuity led them to success, but what happens to those who fail? Far too often, they bury their stories out of shame or humiliation -- and miss out on a valuable opportunity for growth, says author and entrepreneur Leticia Gasca. In this thoughtful talk, Gasca calls for business owners to open up about their failures and makes the case for replacing the idea of ""failing fast"" with a new mantra: fail mindfully. (Watch this talk in Spanish here (https://www.ted.com/talks/leticia_gasca_una_nueva_manera_de_hablar_del_fracaso_en_los_negocios) .)

If you don’t know who you are, you’ll be whoever someone pays you to be.


But you can only pretend for so long.

Those words have stuck with John Emery for a long time. John is a StartupCamp Coach and the founder of Emery Agency (https://startupcamp.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ede877f638f3cce6a0f0d5e0&amp;id=970f6c2584&amp;e=fccb25d0d6) , (https://startupcamp.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ede877f638f3cce6a0f0d5e0&amp;id=6bfbbd6325&amp;e=fccb25d0d6) where they help companies discover their true identity: not who they want to be, not what they think would sell, but who they truly are.

Knowing who you are is crucial to entrepreneurship, and that’s why today’s conversation with John is so important. On this episode of StartupCamp Stories (https://startupcamp.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ede877f638f3cce6a0f0d5e0&amp;id=07969f9719&amp;e=fccb25d0d6) , you’ll learn:

* How to know that you’re being true to yourself, your strengths, and your business
* The one thing John tells all his new hires
* Why you should never wait to resolve the last 20% of your concerns
* What it means to find a “rhythm” between work, family, and rest

As we say at StartupCamp, true freedom and joy comes knowing who you are, and living your life and running your business accordingly. We hope this conversation will inspire you to trust yourself a little more. Listen here.

We’ve been busy here at DataCamp. We’ve recently launched 3 new Courses and 1 new Project for you to expand your data science skills. Check them out below!

Preprocessing for Machine Learning in Python ( https://www.datacamp.com/courses/preprocessing-for-machine-learning-in-python?utm_source=customerio&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=course_6576 )
This Python course covers the basics of how and when to perform data preprocessing. You'll learn how to standardize your data so that it's in the right form for your model, create new features, and select the best features to improve your model fit. Finally, you'll have some practice preprocessing by getting a dataset on UFO sightings (yes, you read that correctly) ready for
modeling.

Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing ( https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing?utm_source=customerio&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=course_7823 )
Convolutional neural networks are deep learning algorithms that are particularly powerful for analysis of images. This Python course will teach you how to construct, train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. You will also learn how to improve their ability to learn from data, and how to interpret the results of the training.

Generating Keywords for Google AdWords ( https://www.datacamp.com/projects/400?utm_source=customerio&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=project_400 )
Automatically generate keywords for a search engine marketing campaign using Python. In this Project, you will pretend to work for a digital marketing agency. You are approached by a massive online retailer of furniture and are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section.

Analyzing Survey Data in R ( https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-survey-data-in-r?utm_source=customerio&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=course_6613 )
Have you ever wondered what goes into designing a survey and how survey responses are turned into actionable
insights? In this course, you will model survey data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using R's survey and tidyverse packages. Following the course, you will be able to successfully interpret survey results and finally find the answers to life's burning questions!

Happy learning!
